# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetingsView.vue currently has pagination implemented, but there are several issues and potential improvements that need to be addressed. The pagination component has incorrect implementation patterns, lacks proper page number display, and has some UX issues that affect the user experience when navigating through meeting data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the meetings list, I want to see proper page numbers in the pagination component, so that I can easily navigate to specific pages and understand my current position in the dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pagination component is displayed THEN the system SHALL show individual page number buttons for easy navigation
2. WHEN there are more than 7 pages THEN the system SHALL show ellipsis (...) to indicate hidden pages
3. WHEN a user clicks on a page number THEN the system SHALL navigate to that specific page
4. WHEN the current page is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a different visual style

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating through meetings, I want the pagination to work correctly with filters and search, so that I can maintain my search context while browsing through results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters or search THEN the system SHALL reset to page 1
2. WHEN pagination state changes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current filter and search parameters
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the applied filters
4. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL reset pagination to page 1

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing meeting data, I want to see clear pagination information, so that I understand how many total meetings exist and which subset I'm currently viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pagination is displayed THEN the system SHALL show "Showing X to Y of Z meetings" information
2. WHEN the user is on the first page THEN the system SHALL show "Showing 1 to [per_page] of [total] meetings"
3. WHEN the user is on the last page THEN the system SHALL show the correct range ending with the total count
4. WHEN there are no results THEN the system SHALL hide pagination information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating through meetings, I want keyboard navigation support for pagination, so that I can efficiently navigate without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses the left arrow key THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous page if available
2. WHEN a user presses the right arrow key THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next page if available
3. WHEN pagination buttons have focus THEN the system SHALL show clear focus indicators
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as mouse clicks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want responsive pagination controls, so that I can easily navigate through meetings on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL show a simplified pagination with prev/next and current page info
2. WHEN viewed on tablet and desktop THEN the system SHALL show full pagination with page numbers
3. WHEN the pagination doesn't fit the screen THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
4. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing meeting data, I want to see loading states during pagination, so that I understand when data is being fetched and can avoid multiple clicks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pagination navigation is triggered THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators on pagination controls
2. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL disable pagination buttons to prevent multiple requests
3. WHEN loading is complete THEN the system SHALL re-enable pagination controls
4. WHEN an error occurs during pagination THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error feedback
