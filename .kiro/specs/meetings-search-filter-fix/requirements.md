# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetingsView component currently has search and filter UI controls (search input, type filter, date range filters) but they are not functioning properly. Users expect to be able to search meetings by topic/description, filter by meeting type, and filter by date range, with the table updating in real-time to show filtered results. The current implementation has the UI elements and some logic in place, but the filtering is not working as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search meetings by topic, so that I can quickly find specific meetings without scrolling through all results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL filter meetings that contain the search term in the topic field using the `topic` API parameter
2. WHEN I clear the search input THEN the system SHALL show all meetings again
3. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL debounce the search to avoid excessive API calls
4. WHEN search results are empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results found" message
5. WHEN I search THEN the pagination SHALL reset to page 1

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter meetings by type (online, offline, hybrid), so that I can focus on specific types of meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a meeting type from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL show only meetings of that type
2. WHEN I select "All types" THEN the system SHALL show meetings of all types
3. WHEN I change the type filter THEN the pagination SHALL reset to page 1
4. WHEN the type filter is active THEN the system SHALL maintain the filter when navigating between pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter meetings by date, so that I can view meetings on a specific date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set a start date THEN the system SHALL show only meetings on that specific date using the `start_time` API parameter
2. WHEN I set an end date THEN the system SHALL show only meetings on that specific date using the `start_time` API parameter
3. WHEN I set both start and end dates THEN the system SHALL use the calendar endpoint (`/api/calendar`) with `start_date` and `end_date` parameters for date range filtering
4. WHEN I clear date filters THEN the system SHALL show all meetings regardless of date
5. WHEN date filters are active THEN the system SHALL maintain the filters when navigating between pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear all active filters at once, so that I can quickly reset the view to show all meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Clear" button THEN the system SHALL reset all filter inputs to their default state
2. WHEN I click the "Clear" button THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all meetings
3. WHEN I click the "Clear" button THEN the pagination SHALL reset to page 1
4. WHEN no filters are active THEN the "Clear" button SHALL still be functional but have no visual effect

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the filter state to persist during pagination, so that I can navigate through filtered results without losing my search criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have active filters and navigate to another page THEN the system SHALL maintain the same filters
2. WHEN I have active filters and navigate pages THEN the system SHALL continue to show only filtered results
3. WHEN I refresh the page with active filters THEN the system SHALL preserve the filter state if possible
4. WHEN pagination controls are used THEN the system SHALL pass current filter parameters to the API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback about active filters, so that I understand what criteria are currently applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL show appropriate visual indicators
2. WHEN no results match the current filters THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating filters are active
3. WHEN the "hasActiveFilters" computed property is true THEN the system SHALL reflect this in the UI
4. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the visual indicators SHALL be removed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter meetings by location, so that I can find meetings in specific locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select or enter a location THEN the system SHALL filter meetings by location name using the `location` API parameter
2. WHEN I clear the location filter THEN the system SHALL show meetings from all locations
3. WHEN location filter is active THEN the system SHALL maintain the filter when navigating between pages
4. WHEN location filter is combined with other filters THEN the system SHALL apply all filters simultaneously

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search and filter functionality to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the application even when network issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search/filter request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN a search/filter request fails THEN the system SHALL provide a retry option
3. WHEN retrying after a failed search/filter THEN the system SHALL use the same filter parameters
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL not clear existing filter inputs
