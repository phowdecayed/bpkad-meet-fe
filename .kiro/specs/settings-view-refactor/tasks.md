# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create TypeScript interfaces for settings data structures

  - Define Setting interface with id, name, group, payload, timestamps
  - Define GroupedSettings interface for organizing settings by group
  - Create types file at src/types/settings.ts
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance settings store with new methods and computed properties

  - Add fetchAllSettings method to retrieve all settings without group filter
  - Add computed property for groupedSettings that organizes settings by group
  - Update existing methods to work with the new data structure
  - Add proper TypeScript typing to store methods
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Create SettingsGroupSection wrapper component

  - Implement component that accepts groupName and settings props
  - Create component mapping logic to determine which settings component to render
  - Add fallback to GenericSettings for unknown group types
  - Include proper TypeScript props interface
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 1.2_

- [x] 4. Create GeneralSettings component for General group

  - Build form-based interface for general application settings
  - Implement form validation and data binding
  - Add save/reset functionality with loading states
  - Include proper error handling and user feedback
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Create GenericSettings fallback component

  - Implement generic key-value display for unknown setting types
  - Add basic JSON editing capabilities for payload data
  - Include warning message about unknown setting type
  - Ensure component doesn't break with unexpected data structures
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Refactor SettingsView.vue to handle multiple groups

  - Replace hardcoded ZoomSettings with dynamic group rendering
  - Implement loading, error, and empty states
  - Add retry functionality for failed API requests
  - Use SettingsGroupSection for each settings group
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Update existing ZoomSettings component integration

  - Ensure ZoomSettings works within the new SettingsGroupSection wrapper
  - Verify props and events are properly handled
  - Test that existing functionality remains intact
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

  - Implement proper error boundaries for component failures
  - Add toast notifications for successful operations
  - Create clear error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Add loading skeletons for better user experience
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Write unit tests for new components and store methods

  - Test SettingsView component rendering and state management
  - Test SettingsGroupSection component mapping logic
  - Test GeneralSettings and GenericSettings components
  - Test enhanced settings store methods and computed properties
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 10. Integration testing and final verification
  - Test complete settings flow from API fetch to component rendering
  - Verify all setting groups render with appropriate components
  - Test CRUD operations work correctly for all group types
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing ZoomSettings functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2_
