# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing SettingsView.vue component to dynamically handle multiple settings groups from the /api/settings endpoint. Currently, the view only displays a hardcoded ZoomSettings component. The refactor will make the settings view flexible to display different setting groups (like "zoom", "General", etc.) based on the API response, allowing for a more scalable and maintainable settings management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view all available settings groups in a single settings page, so that I can manage different types of application settings from one centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch settings data from the /api/settings endpoint
2. WHEN the API returns multiple settings groups THEN the system SHALL display each group as a separate section
3. WHEN settings groups include "zoom" and "General" THEN the system SHALL render appropriate components for each group type
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want each settings group to be visually organized and clearly labeled, so that I can easily identify and manage different categories of settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple settings groups are displayed THEN each group SHALL have a clear visual separation from other groups
2. WHEN a settings group is rendered THEN it SHALL display the group name as a section header
3. WHEN settings are grouped THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical, user-friendly layout
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the settings groups SHALL be sorted in a consistent order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the settings view to be extensible for new setting types, so that adding new settings groups doesn't require major code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new settings group type is added to the API response THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without breaking
2. WHEN the system encounters an unknown settings group THEN it SHALL either render a generic component or skip it without errors
3. WHEN settings components are rendered THEN they SHALL receive the appropriate payload data for their group type
4. IF a settings group component doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue rendering other groups

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the settings to load efficiently and provide feedback during loading, so that I have a smooth user experience when managing settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator while fetching data
2. WHEN settings data is successfully loaded THEN the loading indicator SHALL be hidden and settings SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN the API response is empty THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no settings are available
4. WHEN settings are being saved THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to update settings within each group, so that I can modify application configuration as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify a setting within a group THEN the change SHALL be reflected in the UI immediately
2. WHEN I save settings changes THEN the system SHALL send the updated data to the appropriate API endpoint
3. WHEN settings are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation
4. IF settings save fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
